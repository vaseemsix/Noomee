		to give a small prize-encouragement to your child in the end of the day
		after finishing daily tasks. What he/she likes the most and will work hard for it
		to overcome difficult tasks. For example, if a child loves "Kinder", we use this as an encouragement.
		Remember that you are obligated to restrict the "Kinder" on the other occasions,
		so the child understands that it is a means of encouragement. The child must also
		clearly understands that after each task he/she receives "nums",
		which at the end of the day becomes a prize.</string>
