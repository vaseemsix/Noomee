    <string name="promise">*Note, that you are giving a promise to noomee to give a small prize-encouragement to your child in the end of the day after finishing daily tasks. What he/she likes the most and will work hard for it to overcome difficult tasks. For example, if a child loves "Kinder", we use this as an encouragement. Remember that you are obligated to restrict the "Kinder" on the other occasions, so the child understands that it is a means of encouragement. The child must also clearly understands that after each task he/she receives "nums", which at the end of the day becomes a prize.</string>
